# Film Stock

Film Stock is a personal exercise to test JSON and the use of a fake API as Postman.

The design of this exercise was made with Figma. Several languages like HTML, CSS and JS were used for the obtention of the final product. 

The main aim of the exercise was to succesfully create a web dedicated to cinema where movies could be created, read, updated and deleted throung a fake API as Postman. A JSON file was previously created to data exchange.

### Future ideas

For the enhancement of this exercise I would create I detailed page of every movie, make a functional search bar and the possibility to add more movies from the interface. Also, I would like to link the webpage to a movie API to enhance the user experience as well as to be able to deploy the URL.
