# Film Stock

Film Stock is a personal exercise to test JSON and the use of a fake API as Postman.

The design of this exercise was made with Figma. Several languages like HTML, CSS and JS were used for the obtention of the final product. 

The main aim of the exercise was to succesfully create a web dedicated to cinema where movies could be created, read, updated and deleted throung a fake API as Postman. A JSON file was previously created to data exchange.
